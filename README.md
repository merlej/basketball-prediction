In this project, I used data from a 10 year period to build a model that predicts the outcome of
an NCAA basketball game. The data was collected from several different sources, including Kaggle and 
sports-reference.com. Using this data, I created features and determined which of the features are
useful in predicting whether a team will win or lose.
The DataFiles folder contains all the raw data used for the project. Within the DataFiles folder
there is an additional folder that contains data that was scraped from the web. 
The code folder contains all the code that was used for cleaning and preprocessing the data, and the
code that was used to build the model. 
The reports folder contains several reports describing the project, and includes plots with the results.
